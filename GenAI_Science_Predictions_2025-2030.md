**The 2030 Vision:**

By 2030, Generative AI will be as fundamental to scientific research as the microscope, telescope, or computer. It will not replace human scientists but will amplify human creativity, intuition, and insight to unprecedented levels. The synergy between human intelligence and artificial intelligence will unlock solutions to humanity's greatest challenges: disease, climate change, energy, and materials scarcity.

**Critical Success Factors:**

1. **Responsible Development:** Prioritizing safety, ethics, and equity
2. **Global Collaboration:** Sharing knowledge and resources across borders
3. **Continuous Innovation:** Pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve
4. **Human-Centered Design:** Keeping human values at the core of AI systems
5. **Adaptive Governance:** Evolving policies to match technological progress

The future of science is not AI versus humans—it is AI and humans, working together to expand the frontiers of human knowledge and capability.
